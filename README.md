# StaMBO: Statistical model comparison with bootstrap 

This package is aimed to be a one-stop-shop for statistical testing in machine learning when it comes to evaluating models on a test set. Currently, we do not support multi-label classification, and computing a significane of ranking multiple methods. Below you can find examples on how to do model comparison in classification, regresson, and semantic segmentation.

## Classification

TBD.
## Regression
